# `cxxast`

Build a C++ ast with either libclang or an experimental builtin parser.

This project is no longer maintained and has been archived.

Please consider using [cpptok](https://github.com/strandfield/cpptok) (a simple tokenizer) and/or 
[libclang-utils](https://github.com/strandfield/libclang-utils) (a collection of helper classes for using libclang).

If you want to parse C++ with a higher-level interface than libclang, have a look at 
foonathan's [cppast](https://github.com/foonathan/cppast).
